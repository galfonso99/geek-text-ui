        <br />
        <p>
          A witty and winning new voice comes alive in this infectious road trip
          adventure with a rock-and-roll twist. Shapiro’s debut blends the
          emotional nuance of Elena Ferrante with the potent nostalgia of High
          Fidelity, in a story of two women—one rich and alluring, the other
          just another planet in her dazzling orbit—and their fervid and
          troubled friendship.
          <br />
          From the distance of a few yards, there might be nothing distinctive
          about Lee Parrish, nothing you could put your finger on, and yet, if
          she were to walk into a room, you would notice her. And if you were
          with her, I’d always thought, you could walk into any room.
          <br />
          For quiet, cautious and restless college freshman Vivian Feld real
          life begins the day she moves in with the enigmatic Lee
          Parrish—daughter of died-too-young troubadour Jesse Parrish and
          model-turned-fashion designer Linda West—and her audiophile roommate
          Andy Elliott.
          <br />
          When a one-night stand fractures Lee and Andy’s intimate rapport, Lee
          turns to Viv, inviting her into her glamorous fly-by-night world: an
          intoxicating mix of Hollywood directors, ambitious artists, and
          first-class everything. It is the beginning of a friendship that will
          inexorably shape both women as they embark on the rocky road to
          adulthood. <br />
          More than a decade later, Viv is married to Andy and hasn’t heard from
          Lee in three years. Suddenly, Lee reappears, begging for a favor: she
          wants Viv to help her find the lost album Jesse was recording before
          his death. Holding on to a life-altering secret and ambivalent about
          her path, Viv allows herself to be pulled into Lee’s world once again.
          But the chance to rekindle the magic and mystery of their youth might
          come with a painful lesson: While the sun dazzles us with is warmth
          and brilliance, it may also blind us from seeing what we really
          need.<br />
          What begins as a familiar story of two girls falling under each
          other’s spell evolves into an evocative, and at times irrepressibly
          funny, study of female friendship in all its glorious intensity and
          heartbreaking complexity.

                  There are parts of this book so poignant they made me weep,
                  but almost none of them had to do with the characters
                  themselves. Instead, they were observations on friendships,
                  relationships, and the vicissitudes of time. I loved that
                  there was so much of this novel that I could relate to - a
                  longterm friendship changed by marriage, a baby, life
                  circumstances. It was a bit hard to personally relate to the
                  wealthy "rock heiress" theme at first, but it's believable in
                  the context of the novel. It's especially so given the
                  characters' meeting at a competitive university in Providence.
                  This book is phenomenal - one of the best I have read in the
                  past year or so. I'm sending a copy to my BFF with whom I have
                  lost regular contact in the past 2 years (after thirty yearsof
                  friendship) with hope we can pick up again.
